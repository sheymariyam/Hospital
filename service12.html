            <h1>Symptoms of Cancer</h1>
            <p>Cancer symptoms can vary greatly depending on the type of cancer, but common symptoms include unexplained weight loss, fatigue, persistent pain, changes in skin appearance, and the presence of lumps or abnormal masses. Other symptoms may include difficulty swallowing, persistent cough, changes in bowel or bladder habits, and unexplained bleeding or bruising. It is important to consult a healthcare provider if any of these symptoms persist, as early detection and diagnosis are critical to effective treatment.</p>

        <h2>Success Story: Overcoming Cancer with Comprehensive Care</h2>
        <div class="achievements-box">
            <p>At LifeBridge Hospital, every cancer journey is unique, and one of our most inspiring success stories is that of Jane, a breast cancer survivor. Diagnosed at an early stage, Jane was referred to our oncology team, where she received a comprehensive treatment plan that included surgery, followed by chemotherapy and radiation. Throughout her treatment, Jane received not only expert medical care but also emotional support through our counseling and patient support services.

                Today, Jane is cancer-free and credits the multidisciplinary team at LifeBridge Hospital for her recovery. "The care I received was phenomenal," Jane says. "The doctors, nurses, and staff were with me every step of the way, ensuring I understood my options and felt supported throughout the process. I truly felt like I was part of a family at LifeBridge."</p>
