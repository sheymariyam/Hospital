            <h1>Advanced Neurological Diagnosis and Treatment</h1>
            <p>Our neurology services cover a broad spectrum of conditions, including stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, migraines, and spinal cord disorders. To accurately diagnose these conditions, we offer state-of-the-art diagnostic tools such as MRI and CT imaging, which provide advanced imaging technologies to detect abnormalities in the brain and spine. We use electroencephalograms (EEG) to monitor electrical activity in the brain, particularly in diagnosing epilepsy, and electromyography (EMG) to assess the health of muscles and the nerve cells that control them. Lumbar puncture procedures are also utilized to diagnose conditions affecting the brain and spinal cord by analyzing cerebrospinal fluid.</p>

            <p>Our treatment options include a full range of both non-invasive and surgical therapies. Neurosurgery is available for both traditional and minimally invasive procedures targeting brain and spine conditions. Our dedicated stroke care center provides rapid intervention to minimize the long-term effects of strokes, ensuring immediate, life-saving treatment. For epilepsy management, we offer comprehensive care, including medication management and surgical interventions when necessary. Patients with movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease benefit from advanced therapies, including deep brain stimulation. Our multiple sclerosis care team creates tailored treatment plans to manage and slow the progression of the disease. For those recovering from neurological conditions, we provide rehabilitation services that include physical, occupational, and speech therapy to help patients regain function and independence</p>

        <h2>Success Story: Regaining Independence After Stroke</h2>
        <div class="achievements-box">
            <p>One of our remarkable success stories is that of Linda, a patient in her 50s who suffered a sudden stroke. Rushed to LifeBridge Hospital, Linda received immediate, life-saving treatment from our stroke team, including clot-busting therapy and advanced neuroimaging. Following her initial recovery, Linda participated in our comprehensive stroke rehabilitation program, which included physical therapy, speech therapy, and cognitive rehabilitation to help her regain mobility and communication skills.

                Today, Linda has made a full recovery and is living independently. "The care I received at LifeBridge Hospital was nothing short of miraculous," Linda says. "The quick response from the stroke team and the support I received during rehabilitation gave me back my independence. I’m incredibly grateful for the expertise and compassion of everyone who helped me through this journey."
                
                Linda’s story reflects our commitment to providing timely, expert care for neurological emergencies, as well as the long-term support needed for recovery.</p>
