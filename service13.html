        <h2>Success Story: A New Lease on Life After Heart Surgery</h2>
        <div class="achievements-box">
            <p>One of our most inspiring success stories comes from George, a patient in his late 60s who was experiencing debilitating symptoms of heart disease. After being referred to LifeBridge Hospital, George underwent a comprehensive cardiac evaluation and was diagnosed with severe coronary artery disease. Our cardiology team immediately created a personalized treatment plan, including coronary angioplasty and stent placement to restore blood flow to his heart.

                Following his procedure, George enrolled in our cardiac rehabilitation program, where he received exercise therapy, nutritional counseling, and emotional support to help him regain his strength. Today, George has returned to his active lifestyle and reports feeling better than he has in years. "LifeBridge Hospital gave me my life back," George says. "Their care was thorough, compassionate, and tailored to my needs every step of the way."</p>
